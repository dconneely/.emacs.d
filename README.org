* Emacs Configuration

Personal Emacs init files to make it easier to keep them in synchronization
across multiple sites.

*** Approach

- Use /Easy Customization/ unless it will lead to significant repetition or
  complication.
- Use a separate ~custom.el~ file for the /Easy Customization/ settings only,
  and keep other settings in other files.
- Use the ~use-package~ package so that packages can be added and configured
  with minimal fuss.
- However, use packages sparingly and don't commit them.
- Avoid the various 'starter kits' out there - instead understand and
  incorporate features from them.
- Provide attribution of sources (where possible) for the expressions or
  functions in configuration files (other than ~custom.el~ of course).
